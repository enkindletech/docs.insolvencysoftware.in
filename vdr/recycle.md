Only Case Admin and Case Manager have permission to delete or restore files.
  * Delete: When a folder or file is deleted, it gets moved to Recycle-bin. Any permissions attached to the folder or file is automatically revoked.
  * Restore: The folder or file can be restored by clicking on the 'Restore' icon from the Actions list. On doing so, all files/ folders (including sub-folders and files) will be restored to its original destination. All permissions that were assigned against the folder/ file prior to it getting deleted will be restored. They will also inherit permissions set for the parent folder.
